### WhatsApp Bot Project Description

This project is a **WhatsApp bot** built using the `whatsapp-web.js` library, leveraging **Node.js** and **Puppeteer** to automate interactions with WhatsApp Web. The bot is designed to support multiple commands and is currently configured with the following features:

1. **Supported Commands**:
   - `.ping`: Responds with `Pong!` to test if the bot is active.
   - `.q <query>`: Sends a query to an external API for dynamic responses.
   - `.meme`: Fetches a random meme from a meme API and sends it as an image in the chat.
   - `.tagall`: Tags all participants in a group chat, useful for announcements or group notifications.

2. **Library and Technology Stack**:
   - **Node.js**: Version >= 18.x.
   - **npm**: Version >= 8.x.
   - **whatsapp-web.js**: Library for automating and interacting with WhatsApp Web.
   - **Puppeteer**: A headless browser library used to automate WhatsApp Web interactions.
   - **axios**: Used for making HTTP requests to external APIs for dynamic responses.
   - **qrcode-terminal**: Displays a QR code in the terminal for WhatsApp authentication.

3. **Session Management**:
   The bot uses the `LocalAuth` strategy provided by `whatsapp-web.js` to persist WhatsApp session data, meaning that once authenticated, it can stay logged in across reboots without needing to re-scan the QR code each time.

4. **Deployment Environment**:
   The bot is designed to run on cloud servers like **DigitalOcean** and is typically managed using **pm2** for background running. It supports running on local machines as well.

5. **Command Details**:
   - **`.ping`**: Used to check if the bot is online.
   - **`.q <query>`**: Calls an external API endpoint to get a response based on the provided query.
   - **`.meme`**: Uses the `https://meme-api.com/gimme` endpoint to fetch a random meme.
   - **`.tagall`**: Tags all participants in a group with a custom message.

6. **Running the Bot**:
   - Start the bot using: `npm start` or `node main.js`.
   - Upon initial start, a QR code is generated in the terminal, which must be scanned using the linked WhatsApp account.
   - Once authenticated, the bot will listen for new messages and respond to supported commands.

7. **Common Use Cases**:
   - Running announcements in WhatsApp groups using `.tagall`.
   - Generating random memes with `.meme`.
   - Fetching dynamic information through external API calls using `.q`.
   - Keeping the bot live on cloud servers using `pm2`.

### Additional Information
- **Session Persistence**: The bot uses the `LocalAuth` strategy, which stores session data in the `.wwebjs_auth` folder.
- **Error Handling**: If any command encounters an error, the bot logs the issue to the console without sending a response to the user.
- **Customization**: New commands and features can be easily added to the `commands` folder, making the bot highly extensible.
